# Mav's Animal Shelter Software

This is a local (offline) database system for a theoretical adoption agency.  

It uses Java Swing as it's interfacing GUI and it only allows adding 3 types of animals.  

This project was used to show my proficiency using the Swing framework for my Object-oriented Programming class.
